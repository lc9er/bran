# bran - the list builder

Bran, the List Builder. Build lists with increasing numbers. Useful for quickly 
building test data. 

Completely redundant functionality, but it gives me a chance to learn about Neovim, Lua, and Fennel.

## TODO

DONE 1. Figure out how to pass args to function 
DONE 2. Setup mappings 
DONE 3. Load the module
 4. Better digit formatting (based on list size)
 5. Incorporate the pastery functionality (add new columns)
